# endoscopic-tumor-detection-dqn-cnn
A hybrid CNN + DQN Reinforcement Learning model classifies stomach tumors from endoscopic images. CNN features guide a DQN agent that learns decisions using a reward system focused on reducing missed tumors. This approach improves reliability over a standard CNN and demonstrates RL’s value in medical image classification.
